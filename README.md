# Technical Challenge

## Weather analysis üåßÔ∏è

The technical challenge consisted of working with a dataset containing flight-related information and obtaining the weather of the origin and destination cities of each flight.

## Resources
- Data Source: challenge_dataset.csv
- Software:  Python 3.6.1, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas

## Process 
The following steps were taken in order to carry out the technical challenge:

1. Create a repository in Github. 
2. Install the necessary programs (such as Python and Jupyter) to be able to run the code locally.
3. Import the dataset with the initial information. Review, analyze and clean it.
   - Duplicate flights were removed.
   - Columns containing unneeded information were removed.
   - Columns were reorganized and renamed.
4.  Obtain the combination of unique flights, i.e., unique origins and destinations, along with the latitudes and longitudes of each. 
5.  Iterate through the combination of unique flights to get each IATA code of the flight locations along with their latitudes and longitudes.
6.  Create a list to store each combination of coordinates.
